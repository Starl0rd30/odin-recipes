        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Poha recipe is a popular Maharashtrian breakfast made from flattened rice, herbs and spices.
            It is a staple breakfast in our home which we all love.In Marathi language, 
            the word “Kanda” means onions. 
            By now you know that the Maharashtrian word for flattened or beaten rice is Poha. 
            Hence the term Kanda Poha or Kanda Pohe.</p>

            <p>In some variations of poha recipe, potato is added instead of onions. 
            Some people like to add both onions and potatoes.
            I always add red onions that give a nice sweetish taste. 
            If you are not a fan of red onions, you can try making the recipe with white onions or 
            yellow onions.</p>
